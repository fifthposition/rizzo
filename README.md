Rizzo is a static site generator, written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/). **It is currently usable, but seeking contributors.**

If you clone or otherwise download this project, you can run

`groovy rizzo.groovy -s . -d published`

from the command line (in the project directory), and Rizzo will generate the example site in a subdir called `published`. (In case you perchance seek a live site as an example: My own site, [(incoherencies)](http://incoherencies.net/), is built by Rizzo.)

There is [further explanation](https://github.com/fifthposition/rizzo/wiki) to be had on the wiki.
